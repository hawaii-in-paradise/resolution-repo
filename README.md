This growing, curated knowledge base is extremely valuable for training or fine-tuning an LLM or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for incident resolution. Here’s why:

**How the resolution manager enables model training:**
- Each incident entry contains a problem statement, context, actions taken, and the final resolution—ideal for supervised learning or retrieval.
- The table of contents and links make it easy to build a dataset of (problem, context, resolution) pairs.
- Over time, as more incidents are resolved and documented, you accumulate a high-quality, domain-specific corpus.
- This corpus can be used to:
  - Fine-tune an LLM for your organization’s incident response style.
  - Power a retrieval system (RAG) that surfaces similar past incidents and their solutions.
  - Train classification or recommendation models for triage, labeling, or next-step suggestions.

**Best practices to maximize value for model training:**
- Ensure each entry is as complete and structured as possible (which your form and pipeline already encourage).
- Use consistent formatting and clear section headers in the wiki.
- Optionally, export the wiki to a structured format (CSV, JSON, etc.) for easier ingestion by ML pipelines.

**Summary:**  
Your resolution manager is not just a documentation tool—it is laying the foundation for a powerful, organization-specific incident resolution model or knowledge-augmented LLM.

If you want, I can help you design an export script or a data pipeline to prepare this wiki data for model training or retrieval!
